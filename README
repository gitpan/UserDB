UserDB version 1.00
===================

UserDB is a simple management module for users and groups. It uses a flat file database to store information and as such does not rely on any external resource. It provides an interface to do simple functions for implementing users and groups, and handles errors gracefully. Any method can return 'undef' in case an error happened, the expected value (or true) otherwise.
